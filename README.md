# Tarot Draw

#### :sparkles: [View the live app here!](https://sp-tarot-app.herokuapp.com/)

I developed this app as a way of experimenting with [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/) and honing my data-fetching skills with ReactJS, while indulging my love of tarot and general witchiness.

Tarot Draw uses this [Tarot Rest API](https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api) as a submodule, modified slightly so that it can serve up this front-end app at the same time.
